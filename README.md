Welcome to the Flappy Bird game! This is a simple browser-based game where you control a bird flying between obstacles. The goal is to keep the bird alive as long as possible while accumulating points for passing through obstacles. You can also customize the difficulty level through the settings.

## Features
- Responsive design: Adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Control the bird by clicking anywhere on the screen.
- Dynamic obstacles (clouds at the top and trees at the bottom).
- Score tracking system.
- Settings to adjust the difficulty level.

## Requirements

To run this game, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Flask (or any lightweight Python web server)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Josewathome/flappy-bird.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd flappy-bird-game
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   Create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

   On Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

   Make sure `pip` is installed and up-to-date. Then install all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file should contain at least Flask:

   ```text
   Flask==2.0.1
   ```

## Running the Game

Once you have installed all dependencies, follow these steps to run the game:

1. **Start the Flask development server:**

   In your terminal, run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   By default, the game will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.

2. **Open your browser:**

   Navigate to the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and start playing!

## How to Play

- **Goal**: Control the bird and fly it between obstacles without hitting them.
- **Controls**: Click anywhere on the screen to make the bird "flap" and rise. The bird will automatically fall due to gravity. Avoid obstacles (clouds and trees) by precisely timing your clicks.

### Scoring
- You earn points by successfully navigating between the obstacles.

## Customization

### Difficulty Levels
The game includes three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. You can adjust the difficulty before starting the game. The difficulty setting controls the speed of the obstacles:
- **Easy**: Slower speed for casual play.
- **Medium**: Normal speed.
- **Hard**: Fast speed for experienced players.

To change the difficulty:
1. Before starting the game, select the desired difficulty level from the dropdown menu.
2. Click "Start Game" to begin.

## Game Controls

- **Click anywhere on the screen** to make the bird rise.
- The bird will fall due to gravity if you do not click.
- The goal is to time your clicks perfectly to avoid hitting obstacles.
